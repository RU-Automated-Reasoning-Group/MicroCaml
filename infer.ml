|   env -> A typing environment                                       |

|*********************************************************************|

|   returns an annotated expression of type aexpr that holds          |
|   type information for the given expression e.                      |
|   and the type of e                                                 |
|   and a list of typing constraints.                                 |
|*********************************************************************|
| - This method takes every expression/sub-expression in the          |
|   program and assigns some type information to it.                  |
| - This type information maybe something concrete like a TNum        |
|   or it could be a unique parameterized type(placeholder) such      |
|   as 'a.                                                            |
| - Concrete types are usually assigned when you encounter            |
|   simple literals like 10, true and "hello"                         |
| - Whereas, a random type placeholder is assigned when no            |
|   explicit information is available.                                |
| - The algorithm not only infers types of variables and              |
|   functions defined by user but also of every expression and        |
|   sub-expression since most of the inference happens from           |
|   analyzing these expressions only.                                 |
| - A constraint is a tuple of two typeSchemes. A strict equality     |
|   is being imposed on the two types.                                |
| - Constraints are generated from the expresssion being analyzed,    |
|   for e.g. for the expression ABinop(x, Add, y, t) we can constrain |
|   the types of x, y, and t to be TNum.                              |
| - In short, most of the type checking rules will be added here in   |
|   the form of constraints.                                          |
| - Further, if an expression contains sub-expressions, then          |
|   constraints need to be obtained recursively from the              |
|   subexpressions as well.                                           |
| - Lastly, constraints obtained from sub-expressions should be to    |
|   the left of the constraints obtained from the current expression  |
|   since constraints obtained from current expression holds more     |
|   information than constraints from subexpressions and also later   |
|   on we will be working with these constraints from right to left.  |

|******************************************************************|
| - The unify function takes a bunch of constraints it obtained    |
|   from the collect method and turns them into substitutions.     |
| - It is crucial to remember that these constraints are dependent |
|   on each other, therefore we have separate function unify_one   |
|   and unify.                                                     |
| - Since constraints on the right have more precedence we start   |
|   from the rightmost constraint and unify it by calling the      |
|   unify_one function. unify_one transforms the constraint to a   |
|   substitution. More details given below.                        |
| - Now these substitutions will be applied to both types of the   |
|   second rightmost constraint following which they will be       |
|   unified by again calling the unify_one function.               |
| - This process of unification(unify_one) and substitution(apply) |
|   goes on till all the constraints have been accounted for.      |
| - In the end we get a complete list of substitutions that helps  |
|   resolve types of all expressions in our program.               |

| - If a constraint yields multiple type resolutions then the      |
|   resolutions should be broken up into a list of constraints and |
|   be passed to the unify function.                               |
